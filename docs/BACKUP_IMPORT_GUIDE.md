## üìã Backup File Format & Structure

### JSON Format Overview
Backup files use structured JSON format for maximum compatibility and readability:

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "created_at": "2025-09-11T13:47:54.123456",
    "app_version": "2.0.0",

    "export_options": {
      "include_servers": true,
      "include_theme": true,
      "include_app_settings": false
    }
  },
  "servers": {

Weekly:   Create comprehensive manual backups (ZIP format)
Monthly:  Archive backups to cloud storage or external drives
Release:  Create tagged backups before major version updates
```

### Team Collaboration Workflow
1. **Standardization:**
   - Create a "master" configuration backup for your team
   - Include all common servers and development tools
   - Document any team-specific customizations

2. **Distribution:**
   - Share backup files via version control (Git)
   - Use descriptive filenames: `team_etiket_dev_2025-09-11.json`
   - Include README with setup instructions

3. **Onboarding:**
   - New team members import the standard configuration
   - Reduces setup time from hours to minutes
   - Ensures consistent development environments

### Migration Strategy
```
Pre-Migration:
1. Create full backup of current installation
2. Document any custom modifications
3. Note installed plugins or extensions
4. Export all server configurations

Migration:
1. Install DevServerManager on new system
2. Import configuration backup
3. Verify all paths are correct for new system
4. Test each server individually
5. Update any system-specific paths

Post-Migration:
1. Create new backup of migrated system
2. Update team documentation
3. Archive old system backup for rollback
```

## üö® Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Import Issues

#### File Format Errors
**Symptoms:** "Invalid backup file format" error
**Solutions:**
- Verify file is valid JSON using online JSON validator
- Check file wasn't corrupted during transfer
- Ensure file extension is `.json`
- Try opening file in text editor to inspect content

#### Permission Errors
**Symptoms:** "Access denied" or "Permission error"
**Solutions:**
- Run DevServerManager as administrator (Windows)
- Check file/folder permissions
- Ensure target drive has sufficient space
- Verify backup file isn't read-only

#### Missing Servers After Import
**Symptoms:** Servers don't appear after import
**Solutions:**
- **Restart DevServerManager completely** (most common fix)
- Check if import actually completed successfully
- Verify backup file contains server configurations
- Check application logs for import errors

#### Path Issues
**Symptoms:** Servers imported but won't start
**Solutions:**
- Update server paths for new system
- Check if referenced directories exist
- Verify permissions on server directories
- Update commands for new environment

### Export/Backup Issues

#### Cannot Save Backup File
**Symptoms:** "Failed to create backup" error
**Solutions:**
- Check available disk space
- Verify write permissions to target directory
- Try different export location
- Close any applications that might lock the file

#### Incomplete Backups
**Symptoms:** Backup file smaller than expected
**Solutions:**
- Ensure all DevServerManager services are running
- Check for configuration file corruption
- Verify no servers are in "locked" state
- Review export options to ensure all desired components are selected

#### Large File Sizes
**Note:** This is typically normal behavior
- JSON format is text-based and human-readable
- Large configurations with many servers create larger files
- ZIP backups include additional files and are larger
- Consider selective exports for specific use cases

### Performance Optimization

#### Large Configuration Sets
- Use selective import for specific servers only
- Break large configurations into smaller, focused backups
- Regular cleanup of unused server configurations
- Archive old configurations instead of keeping all active

#### Network/Cloud Storage
- Compress backup files for cloud storage
- Use version control for team backup management
- Consider backup file retention policies
- Regular cleanup of old backup files

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Command Line Integration
For advanced users, backup operations can be integrated into scripts:

```bash
# Create manual backup
cd /path/to/devservermanager
python backup_config.py

# Automated backup script (example)
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
BACKUP_DIR="/backups/devservermanager"
python backup_config.py
mv devserver_backup_*.zip "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$DATE.zip"
```

### Automation Ideas
- **Pre-commit hooks:** Create backups before major code changes
- **CI/CD integration:** Include configuration backups in deployment pipelines
- **Scheduled backups:** Use cron jobs or Task Scheduler for regular backups
- **Cloud sync:** Automatically sync backups to cloud storage

### Custom Backup Scripts
The backup system is extensible for custom needs:
- Modify `backup_config.py` for custom backup content
- Add custom metadata to backup files
- Implement custom validation rules
- Create specialized backup formats for specific use cases
